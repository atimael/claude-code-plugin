## Adding More MCP Servers

You can add custom MCP servers to your local `.claude/.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "server-name": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "package-name"],
    "env": {
      "API_KEY": "your-key"
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**MCP servers not loading?**
1. Restart Claude Code
2. Check that npm/npx is installed
3. Verify network connection (MCP servers download on first use)

**Performance issues?**
- MCP servers run on-demand
- First use may be slower (package download)
- Subsequent uses are fast
