```

### Research Tech Choices

Just ask Claude questions like:
- "Should I use WebSockets or SSE?"
- "How should I structure this database?"
- "What's the best library for X?"

The tech-stack-researcher agent automatically activates and provides detailed, researched answers.

## Philosophy

This setup emphasizes:
- **Type Safety**: Never uses `any` types
- **Best Practices**: Follows modern Next.js/React patterns
- **Productivity**: Reduces repetitive scaffolding
- **Research**: AI-powered tech decisions with evidence

## Requirements

- Claude Code 2.0.13+
- Works with any project (optimized for Next.js + Supabase)

## Customization

After installation, you can customize any command by editing files in `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/agents/`.
